					<h1>Design Management at Quora</h1>
					<div class='pageOverview'>I was the second Design Manager at Quora. I worked on process (e.g. design critiques, hiring, interviewing, onboarding) and supported a team of Product Designers in their career growth and project execution. Below are brief descriptions of some projects that were led by a designer on my team:</div>
				</div>

				<h2>Product Design</h2>

				<div class='section'>
					<div class='imageWrapper'><img src="./index_files/questionHighlights.png" /></div>
					<h3>Question Highlights</h3>
					<p>Writers have many choices for where to spend their limited attention, and we wanted to give them tools to understand if a question was "important" enouth to merit their time. <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Jackson-Mohsenin" target="_blank">Jackson</a> imagined and built <a href="https://blog.quora.com/Highlighting-what%E2%80%99s-important-about-questions" target="_blank">Question Highlights</a>, showing a question's popularity and incentive to be answered. I helped Jackson construct A/B tests for different combinations of metadata, and balance those results against other product considerations.</p>
				</div>

				<div class='section'>
					<div class='imageWrapper'><img src="./index_files/topicFAQs.png" /></div>
					<h3>Topic FAQs</h3>
					<p>With thousands of questions on each topic, it became hard to get an introduction or overview to a new area. <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Xinran-Wang-%E7%8E%8B%E6%AC%A3%E7%84%B6" target="_blank">Xinran</a> worked on a large team building <a href="https://blog.quora.com/Introducing-Topic-FAQs" target="_blank">Topic FAQs</a>, a community-edited list of common and frequently asked questions in a given topic. I worked with Xinran to think through the large product questions (e.g. 'What should count as a common question?'), the moderation rules for community-edited spaces, and the technical implementation of the list editor.</p>
				</div>

				<div class='section'>
					<div class='imageWrapper'><img src="./index_files/mostViewedWriters.png" /></div>
					<h3>Most Viewed Writers</h3>
					<p>Quora's most active writers devoted countless hours to sharing their knowledge on commonly-asked questions. We wanted to celebrate those achievements, and motivate others to do the same in their areas of expertise. <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Jackson-Mohsenin" target="_blank">Jackson</a> led a project to create a leaderboard of writers called <a href="https://blog.quora.com/Most-Viewed-Writers" target="_blank">Most Viewed Writers</a>, a list of writers in a topic area, ranked by the views on their answers. I supported Jackson as he and the team considered how to best incentivize the type of writing we wanted, and how to tailor the product's mechanics to achieve desired outcomes.</p>
				</div>

				<div class='section'>
					<div class='imageWrapper'><img src="./index_files/readingList.png" /></div>
					<h3>Reading List</h3>
					<p>With too much content to read in one sitting, our users were asking for a way to save an answer for later. <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Diana-Gerr" target="_blank">Diana</a> built <a href="https://blog.quora.com/Reading-List-%E2%80%94-A-New-Way-to-Save-Content-to-Read-Later" target="_blank">Reading List</a> which created a "Read Later" button, and an easily-accessible feed of answers that had been marked to read. I worked with Diana on choosing the algorithm that powered this feed, and how to position the feature against other prominent actions on answers.</p>
				</div>



				<h2>Interaction & Visual Design</h2>

				<div class='section'>
					<div class='imageWrapper'><img src="./index_files/answerPage.png" /></div>
					<h3>New Answer Pages</h3>

					<p>We wanted writers to feel proud of their work, and have a dedicated page to share without the distraction of other answers to the same question. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Nikki-Dahan">Nikki</a> designed a clean & simple <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.quora.com/New-Answer-Pages-Cleaner-Simpler-Easier-to-Share">Answer Page</a> that made a Quora answer feel like a blog post. I supported her by giving feedback on the visual details of this page, and entry points from other parts of the product.</p>
				</div>

				<div class='section'>
					<div class='imageWrapper'><img src="./index_files/zenMode.png" /></div>
					<h3>Zen Mode</h3>

					<p>Writers spend many hours crafting their longest answers, and we wanted to give them a minimal canvas free of distractions. <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Jackson-Mohsenin" target="_blank">Jackson</a> designed and implemented <a href="https://productupdates.quora.com/Introducing-Zen-Mode-A-Distraction-Free-Writing-Experience" target="_blank">Zen Mode</a>, a way to focus fully on writing. I gave feedback on interaction details, and helped understand and push through limitations of our front-end infrstraucture.</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Safety and Quality</h2>
				<div class='section'>
					<div class='imageWrapper'><img src="./index_files/answerCollapsing.png" /></div>
					<h3>Content Moderation</h3>
					<p>Scaling Quora's community required new moderation systems. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Diana-Gerr">Diana</a> designed user-facing touchpoints to <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.quora.com/Moderating-With-Care-at-Scale">inform</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.quora.com/Raising-the-quality-bar-improving-how-answers-are-collapsed-on-Quora">educate</a> violators for how they could improve. I supported her by helping develop Quora's overall approach to moderation (including an in-house team of content moderators), and in running user tests to shape the language and messaging strategy.</p>
				</div>


				<div class='section'>
					<div class='imageWrapper'><img src="./index_files/questionDownvote.png" /></div>
					<h3>Question Downvoting</h3>
					<p>Quora's ranking algorithms depended on having some negative signal on problematic content. <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Kah-Hong-Tay-%E6%88%B4%E5%98%89%E5%AE%8F" target="_blank">Kah Hong</a> simplified a complex set of tools into one simple link called <a href="https://productupdates.quora.com/New-Question-Downvoting-One-Simple-Way-to-Tell-Quora-That-a-Question-is-Bad" target="_blank">Question Downvote</a>, which both collected ranking signal and empowered users to clean up their own experience. I helped Kah Hong consider the full landscape of ranking signal features on Quora, and how to position Downvoting within that landscape.</p>
